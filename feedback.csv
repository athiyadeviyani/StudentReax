"
"2018/11/24 9:41:39 PM GMT","INF2C-CS","Great course with interesting content. The lecturer was very good and achieved to focus my interest towards the course."
"2018/11/24 9:42:56 PM GMT","INF2C-CS","The lecture material was well complemented by in-depth yet not overly
confusing support material in the hand outs. Lecturer is light hearted and tries
to make material interesting, which when studied, is actually very helpful on
other areas of the course"
"2018/11/24 10:00:58 PM GMT","DMMR","The lecturer stutters a lot when he explains things and it's difficult to understand him."
"2018/11/24 10:02:35 PM GMT","INF2A","Lecturer is bad at explaining the course and uses a pointer that is hard to see"

"2018/11/24 10:24:18 PM GMT","INF2A","Interesting course with challenging material. Lecturers are ok but they didn’t achieve to draw my interest towards the course. Not very easy to understand"

"2018/11/24 11:12:27 PM GMT","DMMR","Well taught course with good examples and explanations."
"2018/11/24 11:14:08 PM GMT","INF2A","Really enjoyed it, as I felt I was actually doing AI at university and not just basic programming stuff. Teaching could've been better, but I give it a 4/5."
"2018/11/24 11:15:36 PM GMT","INF2C-CS","The course itself was okay. I think it's good to learn how computer systems, memory and instructions work. The professor was really cool and kept the course fun. I didn't find it particularly useful, but it was interesting nonetheless. I give it a 4/5."
"2018/11/24 11:19:02 PM GMT","INF2C-SE","I didn't like this course, because I thought the coursework was boring. Biggest issue was coursework 3, where I didn't feel like I actually developed a software, but instead a prototype. I would've liked more focus on OO-Programming. It did teach me some useful stuff, but I won't give it more than a 3/5."
"2018/11/24 11:22:19 PM GMT","DMMR","I disliked dmmr because it taught me nothing new. I just repeated the same basic proofs, probabilities and combinatorics curriculum that I did in high school. The professor was nice. I give it a 2/5."
"2018/11/24 11:43:37 PM GMT","INF2A","Ok"
"2018/11/24 11:43:43 PM GMT","INF2C-CS","Ok"
"2018/11/24 11:43:53 PM GMT","INF2C-SE","Ok"
"2018/11/25 12:11:36 AM GMT","INF2A","One of the Lecturers is unable to explain important concepts clearly, and this causes a lot of trouble for the students, who have to start learning new difficult ideas on their own. In my opinion she should not lecture"
